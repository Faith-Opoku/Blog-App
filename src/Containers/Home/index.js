            <h3 className="tag1">My Community</h3>
            <p className="firstarticle">‚Äú The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others‚Äù. Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs words remind me that a community can be established through the service of others.
  
  I believe I belong to a community where people are interested in doing volunteer work to help those underprivileged in the society. People in this community believe that everyone is born equal thus needs equal love and care. 
  
  At the orphanage in which I grew up, we cultivated the habit of stuffing stockings filled with presents and donating it to the children‚Äôs ward at Police Hospital on Christmas day. We would sing, dance, act a play about the birth of Jesus, and give the kids a brief understanding about what Christmas is all about.
  
  These activities have really helped me a lot; seeing the sick kids, newborn babies, and dying children all strengthen and build a strong and firm character. They drew me to pursue my goal of becoming a medical doctor
  
  My favorite aspects of this activity were not only about expanding my academic alternatives but also, joining a close community where I learned to cooperate and respect others.
  
  The smiles, love, affection and care shown to the children are irreplaceable and they always remember you for that.

         <h3 className="rape1">The Values Most Import To Me</h3>
         <p className="tag2">Values play a central role in how we construct and live our lives. Understanding what values are and identifying those which are most important to us can help us achieve a satisfying balance in our life. I would like to take you through some of the values that have impacted my life.

Firstly, vision is created in our mind's eye. It is the vehicle that transports our lives to their destinations. I believe that having a laid down vision is important because it is a constant reminder of what I want to do, where I want to go, and what I have to do to get there.

Every vision, in order to be realized, requires commitment. Honoring our promises to stick to the vision makes the difference between achieving it or not. 

Hard work is necessary. It teaches and inculcates perseverance, persistence, and determination. There is nothing sweet without sweat. I believe that when we work diligently, we will achieve great results.

Whatever you value adds value to your life. These values are not only necessary in whatever task I have to complete but together they help me build a great character.

         <p className="tag3">sitting one sunny day washing my quilt, I realized how beautiful yet worn out it looks. there were lots of patches of beautiful colours but at the same time, dull in colour. running threads from stitching the torn places were hanging. oh! I forgot of how there were a variety of colours yet it sums up the whole quilt.

this is how my love story goes.
like the quilt, we are two different set of individuals, with different values and beliefs. 

our love story is as colour and bright as a quilt. we laugh, cheer each other, blow kisses till we can touch the üåû. We motivate each other but arguments and challenges stirs things up..


we are gradually fading. but yeah. like the quilt we still beautiful and make the perfect match. we get dirty and wash away the dirt..
all broken places have been mended like the quilt.

but these scars can't go away. it still exist.
can we let this beautiful quilt fade away. NO!!
we have to get a polish and do the finishing.

so together we become stronger.
this is my love story and it's never ending üíØüòä</p>

         <p className="tag4">
Health and sport are always connected. The benefits of sports are split between mental and physical health. When you practice sports, you are improving your figure, burning calories, and reducing the chances of obesity, as well as the issues that arise as a result of it. They are also known to trigger the use of sugar in the blood, therefore converting glucose into energy. Thanks to the improvement they bring to the heart muscles performance, sports are also known to reduce the risk of various heart diseases.

For a student who constantly struggles with time and finances, as well as busy schedule and demanding professors, exercise is a great way to deal with stress. Taking part in various sports reduces the high levels of stress hormones, enhances the endorphins release, and keeps students away from depression.

2.   Self-Esteem and Self-Confidence
Working alongside friends and achieving big goals gives students a lot of confidence and boosts their self-esteem. Sport for students acts as a productivity and motivational booster. As a result, those who practice sports are known to be more confident of their abilities, more mentally stable, and with higher levels of self-esteem.

 

3.   Communication and Teamwork
In sports, teamwork is an essential factor for success. To be good in sports, you have to collaborate with your trainer and often, with other team members. This has a great impact into the development of communication and teamwork skills.

Of course, such skills are highly valued in the classroom, too, where students have to work hand in hand with their peers and their professors. To be more, communication skills are an amazing addition to the skill set of every individual, especially when a student hops onto the adult world after finishing their education.

Since sports bring students together, it means that every person who practices sports is more likely to have many friends. This helps boost the social skills, too, giving students an essential tool ‚Äì a way to communicate and interact in a successful way.

Of course, sports make for a highly demanding activity, especially if students practice this on a professional level or for professional purposes. Because of the demanding nature of both their studies and their sports team, students are often found in a big hassle, spread thin between the two. Thankfully, a legit custom essay writing service can help with a portion of the burden, allowing the student to participate in sports while maintaining high grades at other subjects, too.
4.   Discipline
You can hardly succeed in any sport unless you have discipline. Sports come with their own set of rules and are often taught by a coach. Therefore, those who choose to pursue sports in their lives can learn an important trait ‚Äì discipline.

Coaches have a lot to teach and not all is about the sports. In addition to passing on the techniques and rules of the sports, coaches teach discipline and time management. The job of a coach is to guide students in the right direction.

When a student practices sports, they have to attend practice at a certain time of the day, practice on regularly basis, and often even have pre-determined nutrition and sleep schedules. Sports require a lot of dedication, proper nutrition, and do not allow for the use of alcohol or drugs. All of this requires a lot of discipline and independence ‚Äì two skills that will be of amazing use for the student in the future.

5.   Energy
Regular exercise slowly boosts the energy level in people. Those who practice sports on a regular basis are known to have higher energy levels. They can spend more hours in the day working, both physically and mentally, without getting tired fast. Athletes are known to perform the harder tasks with fewer struggles than those who don‚Äôt practice sports regularly. To be more, regular exercise is known to boost the focus, which is highly important for a student who has to juggle studying and classes on a regular basis.

Conclusion
With an array of different sports at the disposal of students, it is extremely easy to find something to be passionate about. When you add the tremendous benefits of sports in this equation, benefits that often go beyond these five most important ones, it makes it a grave error not to practice sports while in school.</p>
